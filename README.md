# Deep Reinforcement Learning on Stock Data

This project leverages deep reinforcement learning techniques to analyze and predict stock market trends using historical stock data. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Chainer, and Plotly for data processing, model building, and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess stock data from CSV files.
- **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize stock data using interactive candlestick charts.
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Implement and train reinforcement learning models to make stock trading decisions.
